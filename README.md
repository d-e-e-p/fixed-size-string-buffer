# A pre-allocated ring buffer for std::string messages

A C++ char buffer sized at compile-time that stores string messages in a ring buffer.
When the buffer is full, oldest strings are deleted to make way for the new entries.
Requires at least -std=c++14 .

## Motivation

Some applications need a fixed-size [circular buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
with automatic overwrite of tail messages by the head.  
If the sizes of strings were known, then one way to achive this in C++ would be to 
budget for a target capacity and then pop-on-push like:
```cpp
std::deque<std::string> q;
...
if (q.size() > target_capacity) {
   q.pop_front();
 }
 q.push_back(new_string);
```

Of course, it would be easier to wrap all this into a class that takes care
of pop-on-push opperation behind the scenes. See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/d-e-e-p/fc2697bdef0faa11678fe034d44772d3) .
You could extend this to take into account the sizes of strings added, and 
achive pretty much the same functionality of this library except the ability to pre-allocate 
buffer space on the stack at compile time.

Turns out that's sometimes pretty useful.  For embeded devices we need to limit 
dynamic allocation and maintain plenty of sram headroom.  With an stm32f4 for example, 
the char buffer array can be allocated statically so it ends up in .bss section, 
when can be alloted to a dedicated bank (eg CSRAM). So there is no potential conflict
between buffer and operating heap/stack.

There is also a speed advantage of using this approach:

```bash
make test
./build/bin/Release/fixed_size_string_buffer

average FixedSizeStringBuffer push time is 23ns
average std::deque push time is 93ns
average ratio is 24.7312 %
```

## Getting Started

`make help` gives the following options:

```bash
help                 this message
test                 run tests quickly with ctest
coverage             check code coverage quickly GCC
docs                 generate Doxygen HTML documentation, including API docs
install              install the package to the INSTALL_LOCATION ~/.local
format               format the project sources
gen_single_include   generate an include file combining definition and implementation
```

`make test` builds the example <pre>src/main.c</pre> 

An trivial example could be build using the single_include file :

```cpp
#include "fixed_size_string_buffer.hpp"
int main() {
  char chars[10];
  auto rb = buffer::FixedSizeStringBuffer(chars, 10);
  rb.push("123");
  rb.push("456");
  rb.pop();
  return 0;
}
```

then compiled with:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -Isingle_include test.cpp
./a.out
```

## API

Externally this class looks like a simple queue with infinite space.

```cpp
// Constructor

char buf[12];
auto fsb = buffer::FixedSizeStringBuffer(buf, 12);

// Modifiers
fsb.push("abc");     // inserts element at the end
fsb.pop();           // removes the first element

// Element access

fsb.front();        // access the first element
fsb.back();         // access the last element
fsb.size();         // number of strings in buffer
fsb.empty();        // is the underlying container is empty?
fsb.free_space();   // unused character space in buffer
fsb.at(0);          // string at location=0 (front)

// Debug
fsb.set_debug(true); // turns on debug messages
std::cout << fsb;    // pretty prints the buffer status
```

In this example, three messages stuffed into a buffer that can 
only hold two:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "fixed_size_string_buffer.hpp"

int main() {
  char buf[8] = {0};
  auto foo = buffer::FixedSizeStringBuffer(buf, 8);

  // push strings into buffer
  foo.push("0aa");
  foo.push("1bb");
  foo.push("2cc");  // 0aa gets pushed out to make room for 2cc
  // inspect them
  std::cout << foo << "\n";
  std::cout << "foo.front(): " << foo.front()  << "\n";
  std::cout << "foo.back() : " << foo.back()   << "\n";
  std::cout << "foo[0]     : " << foo[0]       << "\n";
  std::cout << "foo.pop()  : " << foo.pop()    << "\n";
  std::cout << "foo[0]     : " << foo[0]       << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

the result of running this should look like:

```bash
 chars[ 0] = c
 chars[ 1] = a <-- back
 chars[ 2] = a
 chars[ 3] = 1 <-- ptr[ 0] <-- front
 chars[ 4] = b
 chars[ 5] = b
 chars[ 6] = 2 <-- ptr[ 1]
 chars[ 7] = c

   ptr[ 0] = 3 str = 1bb
   ptr[ 1] = 6 str = 2cc

foo.front(): 1bb
foo.back() : 2cc
foo[0]     : 1bb
foo.pop()  : 1bb
foo[0]     : 2cc
```


### Coding style

.clang-format for this code looks like
```bash
Language:        Cpp
BasedOnStyle:  Google
AllowShortBlocksOnASingleLine: true
AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: true
ColumnLimit:     80
BreakBeforeBraces: Stroustrup
```
Roughly following https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html except 
in this case all functions and variables are snake_case.

Instead of c array `char buf[MAX_SIZE];` we could alter the class to accept std array
`std::array<char, MAX_SIZE> buf;` : however this would require templating all classes
and functions:

```cpp
template <size_t SIZE>
class FixedSizeStringBuffer {
  ...
  explicit FixedSizeStringBuffer<size_t>(std::array<char,SIZE> chars)
    : chars_(chars),  max_size_(SIZE)
  {
    clear();
  }
  ...
```

Left as an exercise for reader :-)
